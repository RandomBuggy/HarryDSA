graph traversal -> refers to the process of visting each vertex of a graph

two traversal algorithms
    1. BFS -> Breadth First Search
    2. DFS -> Depth First Search

in a typical graph traversal algorithm, we treaverse a node and append that in a traversed-node-collection.

Exploration -> visiting all the connectee vertexes of a node
In this case we'll use Queue Data Structure (in BFS) and Stack Data Structure (in DFS).
